8. **ParcelMaps**: Maps parcel data to specific tables.
9. **PhotoMaps**: Manages the mapping of photo data.

## Recommendations
- **Normalization**: Ensure that tables are properly normalized to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
- **Indexing**: Review indexing strategies for frequently queried fields to enhance performance.
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation for each table and its relationships to facilitate future development and maintenance.
- **Data Integrity**: Implement additional constraints or triggers as necessary to enforce data integrity rules.

## Follow-up Steps
- Discuss findings and recommendations with the user for potential changes or enhancements.
